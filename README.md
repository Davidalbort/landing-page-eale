# `Introduction`

 * This project was created with react js, styled with module component formatting. The styling was created with mobile first in mind, this was done without media query to avoid rewriting the styling code. 


# `Development process`

* Read and analyze the documentation (challenge)
* Sketching the application interface.
* Creation of components, containers and home page to structure the application with semantic HTML, all this taking into account the Atomic Design methodology.
* The logic for each of the components was made, also two custom hooks were created, one containing the logic of operation and another that brings the information that the server has, finally a context was created so that all the information is throughout the app.
* One modals were created, one for the interface to nav menu, this so that there is no stacking and overflow in the DOM.
* The design was modified taking into account the mobile first, since it was not included in the document, this proposal was taken into account to not use mediaQueri. 
* Creation of styles for components and containers with style module, without media query and taking into account the mobile first.
* Necessary tags were added to have a good SEO performance.
